**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is examining all of the different fairness metrics and their applicability to different fairness issues in data science. For example, we examined how individual and group fairness are two different issues, and there are metrics that are better for measuring one type of fairness over the other, so selecting the right metric to use is essential for truly evaluating fairness.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 Project is examining fairness in the criminal justice system; for example, looking at different machine learning alogirithms that are used for things like court decisions and jury selection, and determining whether these algroithms treat all people equally. I am very interested in examining the jury selection process in particular and looking at how machine learning may play a large role in this area.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I'd make to the approach we took in our current Quarter 1 project is in the feature selection and preprocessing, because the way we cleaned the data and performed EDA to select features may have oversimplified certain aspects of the data. I'm planning to take a step back and look at all the steps we took for things like outlier removal and imputing null values to make sure that we did not change the meaning of any of the data in these processes.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be interested in learning how to measure fairness and build models to do this without necessarily using an existing tool like AIF360. It would be cool to examine how to measure fairness in other ways, and to also examine whether other methods of evaluating fairness line up with the aif360 fairness evaluations.
